# Trie-trees
Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). Here we implement the generation of the representation of a list of words present in 'input_library.txt'- in the form of a trie tree. We have defined operations for finding words with the same prefix, adding a new word to tree or querying if a word exists in the tree.</br>

This implementation has been done both in Python3 and C.</br>

To run the Python file: python3 Trie.py</br>
To run the C file: gcc triefun.c triemain.c</br>
                   ./a.out</br>
